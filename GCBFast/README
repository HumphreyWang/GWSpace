# fastgb

## build the code

In the main folder, to build the software

```
python setup.py build --with-gsl=/path/to/yourgslpath
```
The compiled file will be stored in the `build/lib.**` folder

## test the code

Due to that we only compile the code in the local, so one can link the compiled lib to the tests folder. Using the following command to link the file.
```
cd tests
ln -s ../build/lib.**/fastgb ./

python test_fastgb.py
```
